# Collision Simulation

**Status**: 🚧 Under Development / Incomplete

A physics simulation program demonstrating particle collision detection and response using Raylib.

## Project Overview

This project simulates collisions between particles in a 2D environment, calculating realistic collision responses based on conservation of momentum and energy principles.

## Building & Running

```bash
cc ./collisions.c $(pkg-config --libs --cflags raylib) -o collisions && ./collisions
```

## Requirements

- C compiler (clang/gcc)
- Raylib library

## Current Status

This project is currently incomplete and under active development. Features may be added or modified.
